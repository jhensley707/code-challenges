# code-challenges
During my job search, I've been asked to complete numerous code challenges and coding skill tests. Some of these exercises were very successful. Others, especially sophisticated algorithms, not so much. Often when stymied when a time limit ended, I might fixate on the issue and find a solution later.

This is a compilation of the coding exercises I have delivered.
