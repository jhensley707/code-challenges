# Insightly Coding Skills Test

I have an array stockPrices where:
* The indices are time, as a number of minutes past trade opening time, which was 9:30 am local time.
* The values are the price of Apple stock at that time, in dollars.

For example, the stock cost $500 at 10:00 am, so stockPrices[30] = 500;

Write an efficient algorithm for computing the best profit I could have made from 1 purchase and 1 sale of 1 Apple stock yesterday.

input: [510, 490, 480, 500, 540, 400, 430, 500]
